                    <p>
                        The Meaning of Love is an independent zine project, made with InDesign, of a collection of personal writing and images. The zine delves into the ideas of friendship and love and its many intersecting qualities. While most of the content comes from my hometown in Los Angeles, the inclusion of imagery and thoughts from my time in San Francisco alludes to the ever-changing nature of friendship and the growth that occurs with meeting new people. The Meaning of Love is essentially a love letter to my friends and the time I’ve spent with them, as well as a welcome mat for future connections and friendships to be made.

                      <p>
                              The prompt given was to create a typographic composition using an approximately 80-word passage about language – that’s it. With little direction, I was challenged to create pieces that were visually interesting, making sure to be intentional with my grouping and spacing of words and letters as well as my use of negative space. Initially, I was allowed to use only one font, font size, and weight, and after some time I was able to incorporate an additional font size. This project was really interesting and freeing, even though there were a number of constraints.

                <p>
                    This project was given as a way to become more accustomed to Adobe Illustrator and to combine research with artistic application. I was given the task to create a logo for Muriel Cooper, who was a digital designer, researcher, and educator. She was known for her time at MIT as well as her book and exhibition designs. I created a logo with an asterisk as the base, inspired by her Asterisk exhibition project, as well as her initials which are reminiscent of the logo she created for the MIT Press.

                    Contrast and Inversion
                </h1>

                    experimenting with multiple mediums

                <p>
                    One of my favorite things to experiment with in my art is contrast. I find that I used to be scared of high contrast, so I’d lower brightnesses and make colors within my pieces more muted. While my older work was still interesting despite the lower contrast, I decided to start making my work the opposite of what I was doing for a while. My biggest inspiration came from inverted photos, which I adore. While experimenting with photography and trying to create my own inverted imagery, I realized that I’d only be successful and achieve the look I wanted if I upped the contrast within my work. Once I started implementing that into my photography, I started seeing changes in the way I drew and performed with my other projects. This collection of images are experimental drawings, both traditional and digital, with variations of higher contrast and inverted colors.

                <p>
                    “Olive” is a character I created a couple of years ago with no backstory or real reason. I’m not even sure that’s her name – I just call her that because of her green hair and crimson eyes. Whenever I drew studies of humans in different positions or environments, I ended up drawing her, all in different variations, realistic and otherwise. These two are my favorite iterations of her, made with Procreate.
